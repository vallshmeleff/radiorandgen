# radiorandgen
Random number generator based on the digital stream of Internet radio
We will read the Internet radio stream and look for some kind of sequence of, for example, 16 digits in it. Then we write down the next N numbers, which will be random and which we use for the Vernam cipher as the encryption key.
First app prototype. Listens to an internet radio stream and finds a given sequence of bytes
