The application must work for both the message sender and the message recipient. And the application must use the same decryption key that was used to encrypt the message.
However, if you run this project, it will be seen in the log that 7-9 matches were found in 15 minutes and the same number of encryption keys (cipherbook pages) can be selected from the stream. The sender and receiver may start the Internet radio application at different times and select different keys. 
There are two options for solving the problem: 1. use several selected keys for decoding and some key will turn out to be correct 2. synchronize the moment of listening to the Internet radio stream (without information exchange between the sender and recipient) and immediately determine the desired key.
We use the second option with independent synchronization.
